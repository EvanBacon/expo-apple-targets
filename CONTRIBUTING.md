# How to Contribute

## Code of Conduct

This is not an official Expo project, but rather my (Evan Bacon) personal side-project. It doesn't have a code of conduct, but I expect everyone to be respectful and kind.

## Source

If you want to work against the latest branch for contributions, you can use `apps`. There are currently no continuous tests.

- Run `yarn` in the root of the repo to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` in the root to compile the `packages/`
- Change directory to `apps/widget-demo` and run `xed ios` to open the project in Xcode.
